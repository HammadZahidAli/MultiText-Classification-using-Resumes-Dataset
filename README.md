# MultiText Classification using Resumes Dataset
This note book is implementation of multitext classification problem to classify resumes from 25 unique job categories.
The problem is supervised text classification problem, and our goal is to investigate which supervised machine learning methods are best suited to solve it.

We have 25 unique resume categories & 1200+ resumes to use for model traning purpose.
